"""
We worked with a graph made by NXGraph library, so before using functions,
we had to set proper data structure

"""

#now we get edges attributes, for each category (time,distance,network)

t_attr = nx.get_edge_attributes(G,'time')
d_attr = nx.get_edge_attributes(G,'dist')
n_attr = nx.get_edge_attributes(G,'net')
